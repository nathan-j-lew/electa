# An Ode to Electaâ€”a design research project

### Authentically sourced, written without generative AI

As a challenge for development, this project was written without the use of generative AI assitants like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, etc. To reinforce personal understanding of the code written, all debugging was accomplished with help from official documentation and online forums. All copywriting was personally revised by the authors and contributors of this site.
